## Introduction

Secret Energy is an algorithmic trading robot designed to execute trading strategies using innovative algorithms. It is built to work with the MetaTrader 5 platform and supports various currency pairs including XAUUSD, GBPUSD, EURUSD, AUDUSD, and US30.

## Trading Strategy

The trading strategy implemented by Secret Energy is based on a set of innovative algorithms. The specific details of the trading strategy are not provided in this code, but it can be customized by adding code to the `TradingStrategy()` function.

```csharp
void TradingStrategy()
{
    // Add code for trading strategy here
    // Example: Buy when the moving average crosses above the price
    //         Sell when the moving average crosses below the price
}
```

## Backtest Results

Secret Energy provides the capability to generate backtest results to evaluate the performance of the trading strategy. The backtest results can include metrics such as profit/loss, drawdown, win/loss ratio, etc. The `GenerateBacktestResults()` function can be customized to calculate these metrics.

```csharp
void GenerateBacktestResults()
{
    // Add code to generate backtest results here
    // Example: Calculate profit/loss, drawdown, win/loss ratio, etc.
}
```

## Execution

To execute the Secret Energy software, the `OnStart()` function is called. It performs the following steps:

1. Initialize the Secret Energy software.
2. Connect to the MetaTrader 5 platform.
3. Load historical data.
4. Execute the trading strategy.
5. Generate backtest results.
6. Print the final results.

```csharp
void OnStart()
{
    // Initialize the Secret Energy software
    // Connect to MetaTrader 5 platform
    // Load historical data

    // Execute trading strategy
    TradingStrategy();

    // Generate backtest results
    GenerateBacktestResults();

    // Print final results
    Print('Secret Energy - Trading completed successfully!');
}
```
